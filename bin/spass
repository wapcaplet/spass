spass: Generate a passphrase with lowercase words

Usage:

  $ spass <length> [path_to_dict]

This script generates a plain-English passphrase of at least the given length
(in characters), using random words from the given dictionary file
(/usr/share/dict/words by default). Only lowercase letters a-z will be included
in the output, making passphrases relatively easy to type (though usually
nonsensical).

Examples:

  $ spass 12
  hive frighten

  $ spass 24
  moppet castigator harvesters

  $ spass 32
  munificent icebound raymond clorets

A 32-character passphrase has about 120 bits of entropy, which is overkill for
most purposes. A 24-character passphrase clocks in at about 90 bits of entropy,
suitable for most high-security applications like root passwords or financial
records. You might want to use a password checker to verify the strength of
your passphrase after generating one that you like:
